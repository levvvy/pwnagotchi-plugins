Welcome to the Pwnagotchi Plugins repository! This repository contains a collection of plugins designed to enhance the functionality of your Pwnagotchi device.

## Available Plugins

### WlanSwitcher

The **WlanSwitcher** plugin automatically switches between `wlan0mon` and `wlan1mon` when `wlan1` is detected using Bettercap. It offers seamless connectivity management for your Pwnagotchi device.

- **Features**:
  - Automatic interface switching based on detection.
  - Integration with Bettercap for seamless operation.
  - Visual status updates on the Pwnagotchi display.

For installation instructions and usage details, refer to the [WlanSwitcher documentation](https://github.com/levvvy/pwnagotchi-plugins/blob/main/WlanSwitcher/README.md).
